# Node.js OBS WebSocket Integration

## Introduction
This project creates a simple Node.js server using Express that connects to an OBS Studio instance through WebSockets using the obs-websocket-js library. It allows you to change scenes in OBS by making POST requests to the server. The server listens on a configurable port and communicates with OBS through the OBS WebSocket plugin.
